Just because you're abroad on a budget doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt enjoy the many pleasures of being a nomad. If you make money online, are intentional about where you travel, and follow a smart budget plan the nomadic lifestyle can be more cost-effective than maintaining a traditional lifestyle in many Western countries.

## Make Money online

I make money as a full-time WFH programmer analyist. I'll be tring out various other methods for making money online and will update this post with a link to my notes.

## Create a Smart Budget Plan

Create a smart budget plan and stick to it. So you wont find yourself living the stuff of nightmares: running low on fund$ in a foreign country, without the resources to get to your next destination. We are NOT about living the 'begpacker' lifestyle. üôÖ

Carefully choosing where you store your money, tracking your expenses, and following the rules of your smart budget plan are all key steps to living the dream abroad on a budget.

### 1. Banking

The most important consideration is the bank‚Äôs ability to serve you overseas.

- Does it have low or no ATM fees abroad?
- Does it have 24-hour human customer service?
- Does it have a robust mobile app? (can you easily review your account(s), receive push notifications for all transactions, and can you lock/unlock the card immediatly)
- What if any faud protection does it offer?
- Does it a low exchange rate fees?
- Can you earn intrest on money in your account(s)?

### 2. Expense Tracking

Expense tracking apps offer a simple way to visualize where your fund$ are going and coming from.

- Is it free, pay once or a subscription service?
- Does it allow you to connect your accounts? (bank, credit/debit card, investment accounts, retirement accounts, etc.)
- Does it allow personalization? (set savings goals, track income and bills, create customize spending categories)
- Is it safe to use? (financial information is sensitive so make sure you understand your account(s) and personal data is safe)

I really liked using Mint for budgeting and expense tracking but since it shut down 4/23/24, and I'm not interested in transitioning to Intuit's Credit Karma.

_Frustrated_ is a mild word for how I feel about being forced to transition over to Credit Karma, or lose all the data I've stored in my Mint account over the years. And hear's the kicker, Inuit promises it will be a seamless transtion But (and this is a _big @$$_ but) Credit Karma will _not_ offer actual budgeting. üôÑ

So I've been on the look out for a better tool for managing my money. Until then I'll use good ol' free spreadsheets. If you know of any please let me know.

### 3. Budget Rules

After deciding on an expense tracker its time to try out a few different budgeting plans to see which one best suits your lifestyle.

#### Zero-Sum rule

Your goal is to have exactly $0 in your account at the end of the month. After covering all your needs and wants whatever is left over will go into savings.

**note** be careful not to burn through your money before you have time to stash some of it away. ü§ë

#### 80-20 rule

- 80% for the present
- 20% for the future

#### 50-30-20 rule

- 50% for your needs
- 30% for your wants
- 20% for your future

## 50-30-20 Example

For this example, let's assume we have a minimum monthly budget of at least $1500 USD (after taxes) to travel comfortably in more budget-friendly countries.

### 50% for your Needs ($750/Month):

- **Accommodation**: $500 - should include fast WiFi
- Regular groceries: $200 - buy local and dining in more
- **Passage**: $50 - use public transit: bus, bike, walk
- **Productivity**: $0 - work in accommodation to save $$$

### 30% for your Wants ($450/Month):

- **Adventure**: $150 - choose free or low-cost activities
- **FAT**: $200 - splurage a little wine & dine, you earned it
- Miscellaneous: $100 ‚Äì **TNT** (Try New Things) you're in a new place

### 20% for your Future ($300/Month):

- future **fund$**: Set aside $$$ for a rainy day or purchasing assets.

The 50-30-20 rule ensures all your needs are meet, your wants are not overlooked, and your future fund$ are steadly growing.

## Reduce spending on the essensials

### Stay put Longer

Spending more time in one place has multiple benefits. It allows you to deeply immerse yourself in the local culture and community. Staying put also reduces travel costs and lets you discover hidden gems that you might miss during shorter stays.

Plus, longer stays often mean better deals on extended-stay accommodation.

### Research Accommodation

Your work environment as a digital nomad is pivotal to your success and happiness. When researching accommodation, look for places with fast, reliable Wi-Fi, a comfortable workspace, and is in a setting that aligns with your work needs.

### Get Insurance

Insurance is essential for peace of mind. Investing in comprehensive health and travel insurance protects you from unexpected medical expenses and travel-related mishaps.

### Save & Invest!

I can‚Äôt stress this enough: Investing in your future is key. Whether it‚Äôs in stocks, retirement funds, or other forms of investments, a portion of your budget should be dedicated to growing your future fund$. This is important for being able to enjoy a long-term fulfilling nomad experience.

## Save $$$ on Accommodation

Accommodation expenses are probably the most expensive category in your budget. Finding more cost-effective accommoddation means you could reallocate those savings to another expense like more **FAT** ü§§.

### House/Pet Sitting

House sitting is an excellent way to save on accommodation costs. It involves looking after someone‚Äôs home (and often their pets) while they are away. In exchange, you get to stay in their home for free.

### Volunteer travel

Many hostels and guesthouses offer free or discounted stays in exchange for a few hours of volunteer work each day.

I've added [Worldpackers](https://www.worldpackers.com/) to my **TNT** list, and I'll be sure write a note on my experience with them.

### Hostels/Share house

They offer affordable rates, opportunities to meet fellow travelers, and often include amenities like kitchens, where you can cook your meals to save even more.

## Save $$$ on Transportation

Transportation expenses are probably the second most expensive category in your budget. Using a comparison tool, like [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.com/) is an easy way to cut back on flight costs.

## Be intentional about where you go

Some destinations are more expensive than others, so go where your fund$ go further.

- **Vietnam**: Known for its low cost of living, Vietnam offers a vibrant culture, delicious cuisine, and reliable internet in cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
- **Thailand**: A classic favorite among digital nomads, Thailand combines affordability with a high quality of life. Places like Chiang Mai and Bangkok are hotspots with strong expat communities.
- **Indonesia (Bali)**: _All roads lead to Bali_ is a paradise for digital nomads, offering a unique blend of beautiful landscapes, cultural richness, and a strong community of remote workers. Ubud and Canggu are particularly popular.

## Conclusion

So when they ask you, ‚ÄúHow can you afford to constantly be traveling around the world?‚Äù

You can answer because you:

- make money online
- be intentional about where you travel
- follow a smart budget plan
