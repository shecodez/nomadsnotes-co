## Visa Options for Nomads in Japan

For nomads planning to work remotely in Japan, here are some of the visa options available.

### Temporary Visitor Visa

For brief stays, nomads may apply for a **Temporary Visitor Visa**, which allows stays of up to 90 days for tourism, business meetings, and certain other short-term activities, including attending conferences or conducting market research. However, this visa does not permit employment or paid work within Japan.

### Designated Activities Visa

### Business Manager Visa

Alternatively, those intending to establish a business presence in Japan may consider the **Business Manager visa**, which allows for the operation of a company or business-related activities.

### Digital Nomad Visa

Set to launch by the end of March 2024, Japan’s [Immigration Services Agency](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/) (ISA) announced a new **Digital Nomad visa** which allows remote workers to stay in the country for up to six months. To qualify applicants must meet a few criteria, including a _high_ annual income threshold.

- 1. **Eligibility:** Applicants are required to be a citizen of one of 49 countries that are part of Japan's [visa-free entry program](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) and have a [tax treaty with Japan](https://www.mof.go.jp/english/policy/tax_policy/tax_conventions/tax_convetion_list_en.html) (to avoid double-taxation) to be eligible for Japan's digital nomad visa.
- 2. **Healthcare Requirement** Applicants must have private health insurance, to ensure healthcare coverage without relying on Japan's national health insurance.
- 3. **Anual Income Requirement** Applicants for Japan's digital nomad visa must work for a company outside of Japan and make an annual income of at least ¥10 million – around $68,000. Look, 👀 _I ain't saying they some gold diggers, but they ain't dealin' with no broke figures_.

**note**: If all this sounds a little complicated, most travelers with a passport from one of the [70 countries on the eligibility list](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) are already granted a 90-day (so just under three months) visa exemption on arrival.

## WTF: Japan EDC.

There are several things I _carry_ to make my _every day_ adventures in Japan _worthwhile_. Here's my list of **W**orthwhile **T**ravel **F**inds: Japan Edition:

- **Pocket Wi-Fi/local SIM**: Essential for staying connected while traveling throughout Japan, providing access to maps, translation apps, and communication tools, ensuring seamless navigation and communication.
- **Packable Bag**: A lightweight and compact solution convenient for carrying souvenirs and _essential for carrying all trash accumulated_ while exploring Japan's cities and attractions.
- **Hand Towel**: A multi-purpose item, with many uses including wiping hands or face, removing sweat in hot humid weather, and even serving as an impromptu picnic seat or personal cushion during outdoor activities.
- **Soap Sheets/Hand sanitizer**: Convenient and compact, a portable solution for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene on the go.

## Summary

_Japan doesn't do mediocrity._ If it's a matter of _convenience_ it's either gonna be extremely convenient or inconvenient AF. For example, the Konbini (short for _konbiniensu sutoru_, "convenience store") is a one-stop shop on practically every street corner. You can get delicious and affordable food and drink, pay bills, print stuff, use the ATM, and buy nice souvenirs, and did I mention many are open 24/7? No wonder _convenience_ is in the name. But do you know what's not convenient? The severe lack of trash cans. Where is everyone putting it?! Because the trains and walkways are clean AF, especially after staying in LA. The extreme number of vending machines, combined with my _gotta try 'em all_ mentality, often leaves me with an _inconvenient_ amount of trash in my pack by the end of the day. The same can be said for Japan's _efficiency_; it's either extremely efficient or it's inefficient enough to make you cry 😭, there is no in-between.
