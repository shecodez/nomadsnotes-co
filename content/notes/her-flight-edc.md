## What is her flight EDC?

**EDC** stands for **E**very**D**ay **C**arry, and it's the minimum set of items you carry to feel prepared for every day. **Her flight EDC** is the minimum set of items I, a female, carry to feel prepared for every flight.

## Core EDC

### 1. Phone

### 2. Keys

### 3. Wallet

### 4. Mask

Even with most restrictions lifted, I still carry a mask, even if I’m not required to wear it anymore.

### 5. Pen

## Her short flight EDC

Until now, the EDC has been unisex, but now it’s time to make it **Her EDC**.

### 6. Flex Disk ♀

I used to carry a pad, but, to be more eco-friendly, I switched to **Flex Plant Plus Disc** disposable plant-based period discs. ♻️

### 7. Noise-canceling earbuds

### 8. Hand sanitizer

Even before the ‘Rona I always had some nearby. I keep a bottle in my car, gym bag, and laptop bag, and before WFH (work from home), I used to keep a bottle at my desk.

## Her long-haul flight EDC

### 9. Power bank & Cable

### 10. Flashlight

I like the **OLIGHT IMINI 2 keychain flashlight** because it's tiny, rechargeable, and magnetic. 50 Lumens is good enough to find anything I might drop in the dark on the plane.

### 11. Eye Drops

### 12. First Aid Kit

The absolute essentials required to clean, sterilize, and protect. 😏

- Alcohol wipes
- Topical antibiotic
- Adhesive bandages
- Condom
