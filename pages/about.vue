        <h5>Visual lead - Kai</h5>
        <p>
          Kai is the chief creative co-woofer responsible for turning unattended
          works of art into doggone scraps. With a passion for nibbling on
          critical notes and a fondness for hiding them, Kai leaves a mark on
          every notebook within his grasp.

        <h5>Audio lead - Zir</h5>
        <p>
          Zir, our resident <span line-through>wordsmith</span> nyasmith, knows
          that everyone tuning in to our vlogs is really only there to hear him
          roar. Whether it's the first or final recording of an voice-over due
          the next day, as the lead meow-sayer, Zir dedicates himself tirelessly
          to infusing each one with his distinctive "~nya".

        <h5>Lead's assistant - Zenith Gael (Zen if we're friends)</h5>
        <p>
          Zen is the hand that feeds... the leads. With a background in remote
          software engineering and fondness for stationary, she seeks to balance
          the love of collecting cute stationary with the backsaving adherance
          to minimalism brought on by refusing to stay stationary and getting
          older.
